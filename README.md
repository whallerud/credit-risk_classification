Loan Risk Classification Challenge
This project uses logistic regression to classify loan applications as either low risk or high risk using historical financial data.

Project Overview
Dataset: lending_data.csv

Goal: Train a binary classification model to predict loan_status based on borrower financial features.

Steps Completed
Imported and explored the dataset.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Trained a Logistic Regression model.

Made predictions and evaluated the model using:

Confusion matrix

Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

Results
The model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting low-risk loans.

Moderate performance was observed when identifying high-risk loans.

Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

Usage
Run the script in a Jupyter environment or Python IDE. Ensure the Resources/lending_data.csv file is available relative to the script location.
